# Game Dev Blog 

## 31/6/23: Start of Semester 2

### Overveiw

As last weeks blog post was my Game Development Document, this is the actual first Blog of the semester. Welcome back. 

My time this semester is mostly going to the Final Project, who's outline was in last weeks blog. 

### The Game Itself

I am thinking of remaking the game that i was making last semester, the one about the Money and such, as the concept for that game was good, but the execution was handled poorly. I, in my infinite wisdom have decided that the best way of doing that is to make it in Unreal Engine, dispite my complete lack of skill or knowlege in that area, 'cause it would look cool.

To give myself a good headstart to make sure this gets done on time, I have not done anything and instead worked on my Robotics project.

### Playstation

A bit of a side note, but I tried using a console that isnt a 20 year old Wii or my laptop that becomes 1400Â°C when running Tetris.

A lot of the stuff about how controls affect gameplay make sense now

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

My plan for next week is to Miraculously get better at Unreal Engine

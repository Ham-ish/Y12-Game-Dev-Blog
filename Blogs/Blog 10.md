# Game Dev Blog 

## 8/5/23: The Title

### Overveiw

This Blog is a a little bit late, because on the Monday it was due, I had done two and a half hours of AST Trial, which did not coordinate well with the prospect of doing anything else later that day. 

### Project stuff

 The GDD: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VfzuYC7sJ5dmWzRq2SHc14wcMj44OcP-hhzCon0-Dwc/edit?usp=sharing)

This overviews the concepts that the game will have.

At the time of writing this Blog I am up to part 3.4

If you don't feel like going to all of the the trouble of opening the document, what it effectively contains is the way I will turn the general ideas of "money spend game" into something playable. The part I am curently writing is how I will tie in the game design concepts like a Gameplay Loop, and a Movivation an Satisfaction cycle into the game.

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

The blog this week is not quite as good as the one from last week.

Over the next week I'll probably get more work done on the GDD. Still a couple of weeks for this assignment, but a fairly urgent Math assignment very soon so most of my time is otherwise occupied.

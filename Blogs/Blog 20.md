# Game Dev Blog 

## 14/8/23: Beginning of ICAW things

### Overveiw

The Monday this Blog needs to be written is the Monday before the biggest test in my schooling career. This has caused some problems, including last weeks blog not existing. 

I am going to use this blog to talk about the week before lasts In-class, and then about my current plans for the game

### The In-Class

I am writing about the in-class partially because it was an interesting topic, and partially so when i look back at the in-class some time from now I will know what was actually happening in my head.

The in class was about the necessity of gameplay loop in a successful game (not as spicy a topic as I could have had but ok). I was trying to link to the point from the pdf that was given, which was using gameplay as a tool, rather than some mystical element of a game that makes it good or bad, but then I kept going onto side topics, like defining success, or making those silly little tables. These tangents add to my argument, but left little time to go into what I actually wanted to talk about.

By the end, I was rushing, so I couldn't fix my straight stream of consciousness words, which resulted in the retorical questioning in the second to last paragraph, and the doom and gloom of the last. The last paragraph was not supposed to be that sinister when I was planning it, but it just wrote itself that way.

Overall I don't think it was my worst work. It had examples and tables showing what I meant and it think it had a clear point.

### Current Plans for the game

If you look back at my last couple of blogs, you will not find many references to my game progress, but will instead find a very stress-ed lad. This is concerning. However, to that I say... yeah. There has been little progress on my game dev project, as I can only open any game development tools at home, and all of my time at home has been focused on other subjects. 

I have nothing interesting to update about the game.

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

I hope that by next week i will have something interesting to say about my game by next week.

Worst case scenario, I will finish my robotics soon, and shuffle my study around so that I can devote all of my IT time to Game Dev.

## 13/2/23: And So it Begins

### Overveiw

It is time to begin another year of Game Dev Writings and Readings and Bloggings.

I have decided that in this semester of Game Dev, I will learn Unreal Engine, and then use it to make game. This worries me because I did not really do the first semester of year 11 Game Dev, which contained the Art and Programming parts.

### Unreal Engine

I began the process of learning Unreal Engine by getting access to Unreal Engine, which is where I ran into my first problem. The laptop I am running all of my schoolwork on has less than the minumum specs to run Unreal Engine, so I spent an entire afternoon downloading the various things to make it work to be met with

So I spent too much time redownloading the Engine on my significantly less bad desktop computer and started the *5 hour* tutorial, and immediately encountered something fairly funny. The beginner scene that I was using was a peice of fairly flat terrain made up of a 5 by 5 grid of smaller terrain tiles. As a test I tried to make a piece of smaller terrain transparent, and that crashed it again. This issue happened twice and then vanished, and I began the first twenty minutes of the tutorial then completly remade my blog website in HTML.

### So Basically

Things have started off really well. I am very hopeful that they continue as such.

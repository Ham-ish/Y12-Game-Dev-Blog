## 30/5/23: Concerned blog

### Overveiw

I am Worried.

The submission date for this assessment is rapidly approaching, and I do not have a project I would ever publish under my own name on purpose. With that in mind, I do not have any project progress to show you in this blog.

### The GDD

Bare and Barren.

### My Current ideas

My head is comlpetly empty.

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

I am hoping that I will be removed of this funk before it is too late and my chances are ruined, however, even if I use all of the time I have, I don't think I can get a satisfactory output completed.

## 16/10/23: General Project Overview

### Overveiw

This Blog is an overview for the progress of my project, as well as a general plan for the end of the term.

### Work so far

The project that I am making this semester is a redesign of a game that I made last semester about money and corruption. It is supposed to be a puzzle game with an underlying story of the player being employed by the government to flood the economy with money to destroy the future government, out of pettyness or a need for control. I made a very incomplete prototype last semester, so I have some idea of what it is supposed to look like, and I have the design document with a few ideas as to ho to make the levels and mechanics interesting.

I have chosen a game engine to use to create the game, and have been doing a little bit of practice, getting used to its system and code.

### Current Plans for the game

Godot seems like a good place to make a game. I will progress further in it to create the game. 

To do this I will look at ways other people have mde similar games in Godot and draw inspiration from them for the code and setup of the scenes. 

If I am able to do this properly, I believe that I will have time to finish my project satisfactorily

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

I am presenting this information in front of the class as practice for the project presentation.

Focus on my robotics so that I can finish it to a level that I can devote all of my IT time to making this game.

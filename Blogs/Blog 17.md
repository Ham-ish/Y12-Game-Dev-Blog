### Overveiw

My Game Dev in-class is in 9 days if you include the weekend. This is not a very long time. I plan on focusing a lot of time on preparing for this over the next couple of days, and am going to be writing a practice exam about during this week.

### Topic and Ideas

The topic for the in-class is "Gameplay Loop", that is, the set of actions that the player will preform which will cause the player to play through the game, and how a game uses the same core actions in various ways over and over to have the player play the game. How a movement game has a centeral goal of getting from point A to point B, and its core actions might be finding the target, moving toward the target, getting hindered by something, evading or defeating the hinderance, getting to the target, getting a new target to move to. These discreet actions make up a continious loop which the player does to play the game.

For the Practice Exam, I am going to be writing to the topic of "Addiction is a viable game design technique". My current ideas for this are to go at it from the angle of "Addiction is definitly a viable game design technique, as the player will enjoy the game, and it will also make money for the Game producer" and then when I feel like my writing is getting too facist dictatorship, I will write something about its ethical and moral questionability to rebalance my brain. I thought that this approach would be the best because in class the teacher has been talking about how interesting essays are more likly to get more attention and therefore more marks.

### Gameplay loop PDF

I have been given a PDF on the Gameplay Loop topic, which I have so far glanced over, but I will be looking at more thouroghly during the week.

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

A bit of a short blog this week, but 

Next week Monday, when I will be writing my next blog, is going to be 3 days before my Game Dev in-class, and on the day of my Math in-class, which I believe will be a little bit annoying, but hopefully I should have a notes sheet to bring up the word count.

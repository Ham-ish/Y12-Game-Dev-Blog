## 7/8/23: Start of Semester 2

### Overveiw

Since last week, I have mosly been working on learning how Unreal Engine makes rigged models move, and have been sculpting things in blender. 

### Game Work

This is a rigged robot model. I used the bones to make the character point at the distance

This should be a video of an inflating Doughnut

The reason I have made this doughnut is because I want to try making my own models and actors for this game, before giving up because I remember that I am not any good at making things look good. To do this, I have decided to use Blender, bus as it has been some time since I have used blender and my skills there aren't great, I have decided to start back at the beginning, with the BlenderGuru Doughnut tutorial.

### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

Dispite not miraculously getting better at Unreal Engine, I have begun to understand how the system controls actors and I should be able to move on to working in the real meat and potatos, the coding and logic of it all. Maybe

# Game Dev Blog 

## 20/2/23: More preparing for Cyber Comp

### Overveiw

I know that I am supposed to be using this as a game dev blog, but all of the time that I would have spent on learning Unreal Engine this week has been replaced with Robotics and the Cyber Comp and my Birthday, so I dont have very much Game dev to write about. I will, however, talk about my understanding of the competition.

### What

I don't really understand the competition. all I have gained so-far is an understanding of my inferiority of cyber capacity in comparison to my cohort.

### But my Birthday was cool

I had a good time

### This blog post is not a very good one

I am currently sitting on a tram, in the hot sunat a quarter past 4, desperatly trying to submit somthing, as i will not have access to my computer in a minute. I will write a better blog Next Week

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

Write a better blog

Sit in a better place on the tram

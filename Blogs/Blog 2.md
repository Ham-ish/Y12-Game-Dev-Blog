## 20/2/23: Preparing for Cyber Comp

### Overveiw

Last year I signed up for a (team) capture the flag competition for cyber security , which I then completley ditched my team for, and selept through. This year I am going to rectify this mistake by attending, and then hopfully doing ok at, the same competition. This week I have been going through Grok and PicoCTF practicing my skills, and found out that I am not very good at cyber CTF.

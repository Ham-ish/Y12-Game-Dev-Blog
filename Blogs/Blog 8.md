### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

This was another rather short one, because I spent most of last week writing my DT which I though I had finished, and writing [Some IT Blog](https://ham-ish.github.io/Y12-Game-Dev-Blog/) ([s](https://ham-ish.github.io/Y12-Robotics-Blog/)) so I couldn't get a lot of work done.

As far as a plan for next week goes, it is the same as last week. Keeping the nose at the grindstone of tutorials and hoping that a good game idea comes to mind while I do it.

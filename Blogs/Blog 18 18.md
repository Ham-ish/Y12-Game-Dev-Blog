## 14/8/23: Beginning of ICAW things

### Overveiw

As I suspected last week, the ICAW schedule has impacted my capacity to write blogs. 

I am writing this Blog after I did the in class assesment. I will be talking about the cheat sheet, and how it helped in the actual exam, as well as the in-class itself. 

### The Cheat sheet

It talks about what gameplay loop is and how it is used in the creation of games. I used this information in the in-class to compare the possibility of heartless, profits centered game design future to the cuurent state of the gaming industry.

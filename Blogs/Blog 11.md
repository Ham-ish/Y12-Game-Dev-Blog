### In Conclusion and plan for Next Week

The blog this week is not quite as good as the one from last week.

Over the next week I'll probably get more work done on the GDD. Still a couple of weeks for this assignment, but a fairly urgent Math assignment very soon so most of my time is otherwise occupied.

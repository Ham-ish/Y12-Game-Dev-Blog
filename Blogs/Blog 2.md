## 20/2/23: Preparing for Cyber Comp

### Overveiw

Last year I signed up for a (team) capture the flag competition for cyber security , which I then completley ditched my team for, and selept through. This year I am going to rectify this mistake by attending, and then hopfully doing ok at, the same competition. This week I have been going through Grok and PicoCTF practicing my skills, and found out that I am not very good at cyber CTF.

### Grok

I completed the Cyberlive Module, which is styled off a CTF type event that was fairly easy, the only difficult question being one about changing the RGB and bits in an image to find a code, there are 108 possible combinations which i didn't want to brute force.

### PicoCTF

I did the first 2 questions on this website then got stuck because I couldn't run python code, or I couldn't download a .wav file. This was quite frustrating.

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

I will continue along with PicoCTF dispite my greivances as it seems to be an exelent tool to learn this competition genre and hone problem-solving skills

## 6/3/23: CyberQuest Competition

### Overveiw

Over the weekend I was studying for exams and competing in Cyberquest, so I forgot to write the blog entrys for this week, but now I am writing this Blog right after finishing some exams, and my brain is currenly a bit puddingy. That is also why the posting of it is a little bit late

### Comp

We did the CyberQuest competition, it was quite cool. 

### Did we win?

Yes

### How?

Don't know.

### Did I help?

Probably not much.

I was mostly focusing on the phishing ones and the security structure one

The security structure was just the one that Lockheed Martin uses and is written on a security PDF that is Google-searchable, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the Phishing ones were.

### Preparing for Exams

I have 2 IT exams on Tuesday so I put together some notes that might help.

I also have sources for that stuff.

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week and exams

As the exam is open-laptop, I will do research for the question specifically on-site, and then answer the question from there.

As for the rest of the week, the first three days are exams then there is an athletics carnival, so i only have Friday in class. But I still have that several hour tutorial to go on with so I should be all set for work to do.

I don't know why I haven't finished the tutorial, but I think it might have somthing to with ADHD. Hmm.

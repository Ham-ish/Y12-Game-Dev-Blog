### Overveiw

This week in the tutorial I learned how a master material works. I did not, however, come up with anything close to a good idea for a game.

### Master materials

Master materials are useful things. They are materials for which everything is a parameter. This means you can create an instance of this material, and change the parameters to be any other material.

This is the material that I created to be the master material. Iy has parameters for roughness, metallicness, and normalness, as well as a shade modifier. The texture that I used for it is the "Default texture" because it is very visibly not supposed to be anywhere,

This is a box model imported from the files given by the tutorial man. The texture it uses is an instance of the master material, with textures from the tutorial

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

This was another rather short one, because I spent most of last week writing my DT which I though I had finished, and writing [Some IT Blog](https://ham-ish.github.io/Y12-Game-Dev-Blog/) ([s](https://ham-ish.github.io/Y12-Robotics-Blog/)) so I couldn't get a lot of work done.

As far as a plan for next week goes, it is the same as last week. Keeping the nose at the grindstone of tutorials and hoping that a good game idea comes to mind while I do it.
